# **Project Analysis: Information Architecture**
The information architecture (IA) of this website is designed to provide clarity and easy navigation for users. It is structured into several key sections, ensuring each area has a clear purpose while maintaining a simple user flow.

-Home: The main landing page provides a welcoming introduction, a brief overview of the site’s content, and easy access to key sections such as About Me, Education, Skills, and Contact. The use of headers and sub-headers helps the user quickly understand the content they will encounter.

-About Me: This section contains a detailed description of the user’s background, including personal and professional insights. It’s divided into digestible paragraphs to avoid overwhelming the reader.

-Education: Organized in a timeline-style format, this section highlights the educational journey of the user. Each educational institution is clickable for more details, with each year and qualification clearly listed.

-Skills: Grouped by categories such as technical skills, soft skills, and certifications. This makes it easy for the user to navigate through a wide variety of information and understand the strengths of the website owner.

-Contact: This section provides ways for visitors to get in touch with the website owner, including email and social media links. A separate section for downloading the CV is also provided, ensuring the user can easily access the most relevant information.

The overall information architecture focuses on simplicity and ease of use, with the primary goal of ensuring the user can easily find any information within three clicks.


# **Project Analysis: Visual Design**

The visual design of the website is centered around a modern and minimalist approach to ensure a clean and engaging user experience. Several key decisions were made during the design process to achieve this goal:

-Color Palette: A neutral color scheme with pops of accent colors was chosen. Shades of grey and white serve as the base, creating a calm, professional look, while the accent colors (such as blue or green) are used for calls to action, buttons, and highlights. This choice ensures a visual hierarchy and guides the user’s eye to important elements.

-Typography: A combination of sans-serif fonts was selected for readability and a modern look. The heading fonts are bold and clear, making it easy for users to scan through sections. The body text uses a clean font, with appropriate line spacing to avoid visual clutter.

-Layout: The website follows a mobile-first design strategy. Content is arranged in a straightforward, vertical layout for mobile devices, which adapts well to larger screens for desktop viewing. The layout is responsive and fluid, ensuring the site looks good on all screen sizes.

-Images and Icons: High-quality images are used sparingly to enhance the content, focusing on the user’s portfolio or projects. Icons are added for quick links to social media, email, and phone numbers, offering visual cues for these interactive elements.

-White Space: Adequate use of white space between sections and around content allows the site to feel less cluttered, encouraging visitors to stay longer and engage with the content.

The design decisions are intended to promote usability and create a pleasant, intuitive browsing experience, reflecting the professionalism and skills of the individual showcased on the site.
